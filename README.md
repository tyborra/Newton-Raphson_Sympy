# Newton-Raphson Method using Sympy
The Newton-Raphson method uses an iterative method to find roots of equations. The method begins with an initial guess of the optimal value, then uses the following process until $\theta_{t}<$ a predefined threshold.
$\\\Large \theta _{(t+1)} =  \theta_{t}-\frac{f'(\theta_{t})}{f''(\theta_{t})}$
